# Introduction

Welcome to “The Rust Programming Language,” an introductory book about Rust.
Rust is a fast, friendly, and fearless programming language. As a
general-purpose programming language, Rust is used in production by hundreds of
companies, large and small, for a variety of tasks, such as command line
tools, web services, devops tooling, embedded devices, audio and video
analysis and transcoding, cryptocurrencies, bioinformatics, search enginges,
internet of things applications, machine learning, and even major parts of
the Firefox web browser.

## Who this book is for

This book assumes that you've written code in some other programming
language, but doesn't make any assumptions about which ones. We've tried to
make the material broadly accessible to those from a wide variety of
programming backgrounds. We don't spend a lot of time talking about what
programming *is* or how to think about it; someone new to programming
entirely would be better served by reading a book specifically for those new
to programming.

## How to use this book

This book generally assumes that you're reading it front-to-back, that is, later
chapters build on top of concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier chapters may
not dig into details on a topic, revisiting the topic in a later chapter.

There are two kinds of chapters in this book: concept chapters, and project
chapters. In concept chapters, you'll learn something about some aspect of Rust.
In the project chapters, we'll build small programs together, applying what we've
learned so far. Chapters 2, 12, and 20 are project chapters, the rest are concept
chapters.

Additionally, Chapter 2 is a hands-on introduction to Rust as a
language. We'll cover concepts at a high level, and later chapters will go
into them in detail. If you're the kind of person who likes to get their
hands dirty right away, Chapter 2 is great for that. If you're *really* that
kind of person, you may even wish to skip over chapter 3, which covers
features that are very similar to other programming languages. By contrast,
if you're a particularly meticulous learner who prefers to learn every detail
before moving onto the next, you may want to skip chapter two and go straight
to chapter 3.

In the end, there's no wrong way to read a book: if you want to skip ahead,
go for it! You may have to jump back if you find things confusing. Do
whatever works for you.

An important part of the process of learning Rust is learning how to read
the error messages that the compiler gives you. As such, we'll be showing
a lot of code that doesn't compile, and the error message the compiler
will show you in that situation. As such, if you pick a random example,
it may not compile! Please read the surrounding text to make sure that
you didn't happen to pick one of the in-progress examples.

Finally, there are some appendices. These contain useful information about
the language in a more reference-like format.
